# Unicafe

Like most companies, [Unicafe](https://www.unicafe.fi/#/9/4) collects feedback from its customers. Your task is to implement a web application for collecting customer feedback. There are only three options for feedback: _good_, _neutral_, and _bad_.

## User stories

Application displays the total amount of collected feedback for each category.

#### 1.7: unicafe step2
Application  shows more statistics about the gathered feedback: the total number of collected feedback, the average score (good: 1, neutral: 0, bad: -1) and the percentage of positive feedback.

#### 1.8: unicafe step3

Application displays so the statistics is extracted into its own  _Statistics_  component.
